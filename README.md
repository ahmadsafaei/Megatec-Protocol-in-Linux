# Megatec-Protocol-in-Linux
# Monitoring UPS Devices with the Megatec Protocol in Linux
## 
The Megatec Protocol is one of the most widely used and reliable standards for communication with Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS). Developed by the Taiwanese company Megatec, this ASCII-structured protocol enables monitoring and controlling UPS devices through communication ports like RS232 or USB. Key features of this protocol include simplicity, reliability, and the ability to monitor parameters such as battery voltage, charging status, load, and input/output power status.

UPS devices based on the Megatec Protocol are primarily designed for SOHO (Small Office/Home Office) environments, personal servers, or small setups. However, they are not typically suitable for data centers due to the following limitations:

Lack of advanced networking communication options (e.g., SNMP or MODBUS).
Limited power capacity, typically up to a few kilowatts.
Insufficient reliability and redundancy for large-scale data center requirements.

Nevertheless, these UPS devices might still be deployed in small-scale data centers or branch offices due to their affordability. Monitoring such UPS devices and providing real-time reporting for decision-making after critical events is often a challenge for network administrators.

In this article, we aim to demonstrate how to monitor a UPS device using the Megatec Protocol with an Ubuntu Linux server. We will fetch data from the UPS and utilize it for notifications and informed decision-making.

# Step-by-Step Implementation
# Step 1: Check USB Connection
First, ensure that the UPS is connected to the server via USB by running the following command:
```
sudo apt-get install usbutils  
lsusb
```
Example output:
```
Bus 002 Device 004: ID 0665:5161 Cypress Semiconductor USB to Serial
```
Here, we identify the device by its Vendor ID (0665) and Product ID (5161).
# Step 2: Retrieve Device Details
To gather detailed information about the connected UPS, use:
```
sudo lsusb -v -d 0665:5161
```
This command provides various details, such as manufacturer and product identifiers, device description, interfaces, communication protocols, etc.

Key details of interest:

Endpoint Address:
Interface and Class:
Maximum Packet Size:
Polling Interval:

# Step 3: Install HIDAPI Library
Install the HIDAPI library for USB communication:
```
sudo apt-get install libhidapi-dev
```
# Step 4: Install Required Tools and Libraries
Install necessary packages, including build-essential for GCC and related tools:
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential libusb-1.0-0-dev
```
# Step 5: Write and Compile the C Program
Use the following C program to fetch data from the UPS:
```
#include <stdio.h>  
#include <stdlib.h>  
#include <unistd.h>   // For sleep function  
#include <hidapi/hidapi.h>  
#include <string.h>   // For string processing  

#define VENDOR_ID  0x0665  
#define PRODUCT_ID 0x5161  
#define TIMEOUT 5000  // Timeout in milliseconds  
#define BUFFER_SIZE 64 // Buffer size for data read  

int main() {  
    int res;  
    hid_device *handle;  
    unsigned char command[] = {0x51, 0x31, 0x0D}; // "Q1" command with CR  
    unsigned char response[BUFFER_SIZE];  
    unsigned char full_response[1024];  
    int full_response_len = 0;  

    // Initialize HIDAPI  
    if (hid_init()) {  
        printf("Failed to initialize HIDAPI.\n");  
        return 1;  
    }  

    // Open the device  
    handle = hid_open(VENDOR_ID, PRODUCT_ID, NULL);  
    if (!handle) {  
        printf("Failed to open UPS device.\n");  
        return 1;  
    }  
    printf("UPS device connected.\n");  

    // Send command  
    res = hid_write(handle, command, sizeof(command));  
    if (res < 0) {  
        printf("Failed to send command.\n");  
    } else {  
        printf("Command sent successfully.\n");  
    }  

    // Wait before reading  
    sleep(1);  

    // Read data  
    while (1) {  
        res = hid_read_timeout(handle, response, sizeof(response), TIMEOUT);  
        if (res > 0) {  
            for (int i = 0; i < res; i++) {  
                full_response[full_response_len++] = response[i];  
            }  
            if (full_response_len > 0 && full_response[full_response_len - 1] == '\0') {  
                break;  
            }  
        } else {  
            printf("Failed to read response or timeout.\n");  
            break;  
        }  
    }  

    // Null-terminate and print full response  
    full_response[full_response_len] = '\0';  
    printf("Full response: %s\n", full_response);  

    // Parse response data  
    float input_voltage, output_voltage, battery_voltage, load, frequency, avr, temperature;  
    char error_code[16] = {0};  

    int parsed_values = sscanf((char *)full_response, "(%f %f %f %f %f %f %f %15s)",  
                               &input_voltage, &output_voltage, &battery_voltage, &load,  
                               &frequency, &avr, &temperature, error_code);  

    if (parsed_values == 8) {  
        printf("Input Voltage: %.1f V\n", input_voltage);  
        printf("Output Voltage: %.1f V\n", output_voltage);  
        printf("Battery Voltage: %.1f V\n", battery_voltage);  
        printf("Load: %.1f %%\n", load);  
        printf("Frequency: %.1f Hz\n", frequency);  
        printf("Battery/Sound/AVR: %.2f\n", avr);  
        printf("Temperature: %.1f C\n", temperature);  
        printf("Error or Status Code: %s\n", error_code);  
    } else {  
        printf("Failed to parse response. Parsed values: %d\n", parsed_values);  
    }  

    // Close device  
    hid_close(handle);  
    hid_exit();  

    return 0;  
}
```
Compile the program using:
```
gcc -o ups_control ups_control.c -lhidapi-hidraw
```
Run the executable with:
```
./ups_control
```
Example output:
